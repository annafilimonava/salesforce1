    <textOnly>The stage of the opportunity &#39;{!Opportunity.Name}&#39; has been moved back to &#39;Internal Sign Off&#39; and the Approval Status has been reset to &#39;Not Approved&#39;.  This is due to the Acquiring Fees having been updated, hence you must submit the Opportunity for approval again.

Click on the link to go directly to the opportunity.
