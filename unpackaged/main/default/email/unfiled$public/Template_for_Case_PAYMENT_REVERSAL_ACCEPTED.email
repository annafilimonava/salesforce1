Dear&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There appears to of been an issue with the transactions and it was interrupted. This caused the transaction to be authorised but not fully completed&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If funds have been taken they should be returned by their card issuer in a number of days as the transactions wasn&rsquo;t completed, the time taken will depend on the customer&rsquo;s card issuer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In this instance the customer should call their bank/card issuer to confirm the status of this authorisation to see if the funds have been returned as these will not show as a credit but will be made available again in their balance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Kind Regards,<br />
&nbsp;
