This event heralded a fresh start for retailers across Europe as they continue to welcome customers back in-store.<br /> <br /> I thought you would be interested to know that we’ve just published our </span><a href="https://www.planetpayment.com/media/5354/planet-retail-report.pdf"><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">Planet Retail Report</span></a><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;"> "The best of online in-store: Retail’s next big prize".<br /> <br /> I'd like you to be one of the first people to receive the report. In the report, we look at ways in which retailers can deliver better shopping experiences, convenience, and value while generating more revenue from payments. &nbsp;<br /> <br /> <span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">We also identify how you can:</span></span></p> 
      <ul> 
       <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;"><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">Build a true unified commerce model that links online and offline to unlimited inventories</span></span></li> 
       <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;"><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">Make life easier by consolidating&nbsp;multiple supplier arrangements onto one platform</span></span></li> 
       <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;"><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">Better understand your customers with richer data and deeper insights through a single customer view.</span></span></li> 
      </ul> <span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;"><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow&quot;">If you would like to discuss any of the ideas further and get some more Tinngggg in your payments, then please let me know and we can arrange a call.<br /> <br /> Happy reading!<br /> <br /> All the best,</span></span></td>
