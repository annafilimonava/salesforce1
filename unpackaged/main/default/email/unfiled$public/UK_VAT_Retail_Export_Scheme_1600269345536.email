It will take away your Tax Free revenues, and it will further hurt Travel &amp; Tourism.<br /> <br /> Please rest assured that we are working with industry leaders to build a response and a far-reaching campaign. The first initial actions of this have already been put into action. Alongside our partners such as AIR and NWEC, we are part of a powerful consortium aiming to reach and influence policy decision makers, politicians, and national, broadcast and trade media.<br /> <br /> We are working together to protect jobs across Retail and beyond, to increase the UK’s competitive advantage, and to improve our nation’s economic health, both now and in the long term.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> <b>Our collective aim is to reverse the government’s decision to abolish Tax Free shopping in the UK for all countries.</b></span></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">The government’s decision leaves a gaping hole in the UK economy, and encourage international tourists to spend their money anywhere but in the UK</span></li> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">On top of COVID-19 ravaging our economy and the lives and families across the UK retail sector, this is a &pound;5.6 billion hit being forced onto the UK economy</span></li> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">It is at odds with the government’s stated ambitions for a “Global Britain”, with wider ramifications for Travel &amp; Tourism, and Hospitality</span></li> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">From 1st January, UK citizens will be encouraged to shop Tax Free across the EU rather than spend in the UK</span></li> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">Total annual spending by international visitors in the UK is over &pound;22 billion, so we fail to understand why a decision would be made to reduce tourism in any way</span></li> 
   <li><span style="font-family:&quot;Barlow Light&quot;">We are taking legal advice on how best to examine the process that led to this decision</span></li>
